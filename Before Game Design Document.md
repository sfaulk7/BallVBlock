# MainObjective
> You(The Player) are a rectangle that has a goal to remove all of the blocks from the game.
> In order to do this you have to bounce the projectiles that come at you and bounce them at the blocks to get rid of them.
> If you lose the ball then the game will be over.
> If you eliminate all of the blocks in the game than the game will be over and you will win.

# DesignPillars
> BallVBlock is a fast paced arcade game that takes inspiration from the 1986 game "Arkanoid".
> As the player you will have to be ready at any moment for the ball to bounce.

# Actors
> There are 3 main Actors in the game.
> The first is the player which is a rectangle.
> The second actor is the ball that you have to use to defeat the blocks.
> The third actor is the blocks that you will be trying to eliminate.

# Interface
> The controls to the game are very simple, the only movement buttons are "A" and "D".
> The player can only move horizontally and you need to react quickly in order to hit the ball back at the blocks.
> It is the "A" key on the keyboard to move left and the "D" key to move right.

# ArtStyle
> BallVBlock is a very colorful game, the blocks that you are eliminating will be a different set of color for each row.
> The Player and Ball will be a constant color.
> The background of the game is blue.
