# MainObjective
> As the Player your goal is to keep as much balls up into the area as possible.
> Your score will go up by 1 point for each ball that you hit.
> In order to do this you will have to use your rectangle that you control and your movement to keep the balls up.
> If a ball exits the window before you hit one, a new one will spawn in.
> If 10 balls exit the game, then the game is over.

# DesignPillars
> BallVBlock is a fast paced arcade game that takes inspiration from the hit 1986 game "Arkanoid" developed by Taito and Imagine Software and published by Romstar.
> As the player, you will have to react quickly to keep as much balls up as possible.

# Actors
> There are 2 main actors in the game.
> The first is the player which is a rectangle.
> The second is the balls that you will have to keep up as long as possible.

# Interface
> The controls to the game are very simple and easy to use, you only have two buttons which are "A" and "D".
> As the player you can only move horizontally and it is your job to predict and hit back the balls wherever they bounce from.
> The "A" Key is used to move the Player left while the "D" key is used to move the player right in the game.

# ArtStyle
> BallVBlock has a black background in the game.
>  The player is a red rectangle.
> The Balls are red circles with slightly larger green circles around them showing the collision area for the balls.
